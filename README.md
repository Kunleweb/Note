Welcome to the development of my RESTFUL apis for a note taking application; here I will attempt to
describe the architecture and list all the endpoints

1) The Login page : obviously: at this initial stage there wont be any authentication. 
 But the goal would be to login with stored password that is created in signup#. This is a
 POST request 

2) SignUp : POST request; the accepted credentials must follow schema rules

Once logged in what should be the default page widgets or features:
- ALL notes (Click on this will list saved notes (Clicking on one would lead to different endpoints)) : GET REQUEST
- New Note : POST request

Thats all for now!!


4) Four our db: we will use a json file for now.




<!-- ACTIONS POINTS -->
- Now we need to show the notes that has been stored in db and list it in all notes
